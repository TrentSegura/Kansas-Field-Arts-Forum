            The <strong>Kansas Field Arts Forum</strong> is a three-week
            intensive place-based pilot program collaboratively
            designed by the Kansas Creative Arts Industries Commission and M12
            STUDIO, with generous support from Pratt Community College, and
            others. Designed as an experiential learning opportunity for
            emerging practitioners in the fields of New Rural Arts, Art &
            Ecology, Social and Environmental Art, and Creative Placemaking,
            participants in this program will visit numerous sites of social,
            ecological and cultural significance across the High Plains and
            Tablelands of rural Kansas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifteen participants will be accepted to participate in the 2022
            pilot program and will be notified by mid-May. The dates of the
            Forum are <strong>June 14-July 2</strong> and require full-time residence in Pratt,
            Kansas during that period. Lodging is provided at no cost by Pratt
            Community College. Each person has private sleeping quarters and
            shares a non-gendered bathroom with their neighbor on campus. This
            program provides up to two meals per day at no cost through the
            college. Participants are required to send a non-refundable payment
            of $100 to secure their spot and help cover the cost of group travel
            activities. Participants are responsible for their own
            transportation to and from Pratt Community College, and should be
            prepared to cover the cost of some meals and most art supplies on
            their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kansas Field Arts Forum is intended to increase the appreciation
            and understanding of issues related to rural environments, provide a
            supportive atmosphere to engage and educate, and provide access to
            cutting edge curriculum and guest faculty members/practitioners. The
            Kansas Field Arts Forum culminates with an exhibition and community
            art loop at the Vernon Filley Art Museum.
